homebrew-counterpart
====================

A very simple homebrew repository to install [Counterpart](https://github.com/jedda/Counterpart/), and it's dependencies.

NOTE: As of version 1.2, Counterpart depends on and installs rsync 3.0.9. As of this being written, rsync version 3.1.0 is broken on Mac OS X, and is unusable as a basis for Counterpart. 3.0.9 performs perfectly, and as such, is utilised by Counterpart. More information on the issues with rsync version 3.1.0 can be found [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/issues/254).

To install the latest version:

See the [INSTALL](https://github.com/jedda/Counterpart/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file for Counterpart.
